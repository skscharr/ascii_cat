# ASCII Cat
## Cats on Your Command Line!

Works only with Python2.7

To install: `python setup.py install`

__Note:__ Pillow is a dependency of this project. When I initially set this up on my Mac I had no trouble installing Pillow, but when I switched over to my Ubuntu machine I got the error `ValueError: jpeg is required unless explicitly disabled using --disable-jpeg, aborting`. To get past this I installed libjpeg with `sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev`, so if you're trying to install this and run into that error make sure you install libjpeg
